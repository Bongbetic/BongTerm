# BongTerm Handoff — `1.exit` measurable subset landed — 2026-05-31

## TL;DR

- **LATE-SESSION (interactive): the real wgpu renderer is wired into the app and
  visually confirmed** (commit `60755bb`). `bongterm-app` now renders the terminal
  grid through `bongterm-render::TerminalPipeline` (cryoglyph / cosmic-text 0.15)
  via Iced's shader widget — the scaffold `prepare`/`draw` stubs are implemented.
  The user ran `cargo run -p bongterm-app` and confirmed glyphs render on both the
  baseline (iced-text) and the new wgpu path. The long-open "GUI visual unverified"
  question is **answered ✅**. Renderer fidelity is intentionally minimal (no
  colour/attrs, no cursor, fixed 80×24, full redraw per tick) — next increments.
- Picked up orca `[next] = 1.exit` (Phase-1 exit gates). First found and fixed a
  **gate-numbering error**: orca's inline labels were off-by-one vs the canonical
  spec §6.1. The Phase-1 set is §6.1 **{1,4,5,6,7,8,17,28,29}** — #1 is *shell-
  profile launch* (not keystroke-to-glyph); #2/#3 (renderer perf) are deliberately
  **excluded** from Phase 1. New `docs/phase1-exit-gates.md` triages all nine.
- **Built + verified + wired + committed**: 4 gates **fully** (**#1** shell-smoke,
  **#8** blocks, **#28** settings recovery, **#29** storage recovery) + **#5-RSS as a
  PARTIAL headless engine-core lower-bound tripwire** (it does not spin up the
  window/wgpu/render loop, so it does NOT verify the full-app 120 MB budget — do not
  count it as #5 done). Commits `b81eaf0`→`2e0947e` on `master`.
- **5 gates remain BLOCKED** on the same root cause — the real subsystems
  (renderer / mux / ledger) are not wired into `bongterm-app`. These need a
  GPU/display **and a human visual check**: #4 cold-start-to-first-frame,
  #5-VRAM, #6 idle CPU, #7 split panes, #17 dashboard attribution. They were
  **not faked green** (per the documented anti-gate-gaming discipline).
- Post-session truth: `cargo test --workspace` = **350 pass / 0 fail / 1 ignored**;
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
  --all-features -- -D warnings` clean. Verified by direct runs, not trusted.

## Commits this session (on `master`, oldest→newest)

| Commit | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| `b81eaf0` | docs(orca): triage 1.exit gates; fix off-by-one gate labels (+ `docs/phase1-exit-gates.md`). |
| `33add16` | feat(1.exit): gates **#1** shell-smoke + **#5-RSS** wired into `nightly.yml`. |
| `e87beb5` | feat(1.exit): gates **#8** blocks (corpus + latency p99) + **#29** storage recovery. |
| `2e0947e` | feat(1.exit): gate **#28** settings recovery — backup + Safe Mode + schema migration (real logic built in `bongterm-settings`). |
| *(pending)* | docs: mark 1.exit measurable subset done in orca + triage + this handoff. |

## Gate evidence (verified locally this session)

| Gate | Observable | Result |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | shell profiles launch (real ConPTY→`bongterm-term`→snapshot) | PASS 4/6: CMD, Windows PowerShell, PowerShell 7, SSH. SKIP-logged: Git Bash, WSL (no distro; `bash.exe` here is the WSL shim). CMD + WinPS are required so it can't pass vacuously. |
| #5 (RSS, **PARTIAL**) | headless engine-core RSS lower-bound | **9.8 MB** via real `bongterm-ledger::CurrentProcessSampler` (`GetProcessMemoryInfo`), but **with no window/wgpu/render loop** — a floor on the engine, NOT the full-app 120 MB gate. Full #5 (RSS+VRAM) BLOCKED on the renderer. |
| #8 | block-detection corpus + latency p99 ≤ 5 ms | fixture corpus green + **p99 500 ns** over 10k iters (real `parse_osc 133;D → BlockBuilder::push → confidence()`). |
| #28 | settings load + validation-fail + backup + Safe Mode + migration | new logic in `bongterm-settings`; `settings_migration_and_last_known_good` drives all paths (backup read off disk + byte-compared; v1→v2 migration preserves user fields). |
| #29 | SQLite + sidecar recovery: torn / checksum / corrupt-DB | `storage_recovery_suite` green; corrupt DB → `SqliteStore::open()` `Err "file is not a database"` (WAL pragma forces page-1 read), no panic, no fabrication. |

CI steps added to `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (one per gate, `--nocapture` so the
measured numbers surface in CI logs).

## Two real defects/notes surfaced (not yet actioned)

1. **`bongterm-ledger` doc-vs-code lie:** `CurrentProcessSampler`'s doc comment claims
   a `register_pid` method for child-PID attribution — **it does not exist**; the
   sampler only measures the current process. This is exactly the missing capability
   gate **#17** (dashboard attribution) needs. Fix the doc OR build the method — but
   build it **as part of the #17 app wiring**, not in isolation: the per-pane
   PID→pane mapping it must expose is defined by how the app spawns shells into
   panes, so a flat standalone `register_pid` would likely be reshaped (rework).
2. **rustfmt nightly drift** (pre-existing): `rustfmt.toml` declares nightly-only opts
   ignored by the stable fmt gate — harmless now, latent. (Unchanged from prior handoff.)

## Next session — the integration wall (its own session + a human)

The remaining Phase-1 gates all need the real subsystems wired into `bongterm-app`,
which currently runs a single iced-`text` `TerminalSession` and consumes none of
`render`/`mux`/`ledger`. Honest path:

1. ✅ **DONE (`60755bb`): wire `bongterm-render::TerminalPipeline` into the app.**
   Renderer fidelity increments remain (interactive, human visual): **colour/attrs**
   (snapshot→renderer is codepoint-only today), **cursor**, **resize** (fixed 80×24),
   **redraw-on-change** (full redraw every 33 ms tick now → likely a #6 idle-CPU
   problem). Colour/attrs needs a richer render snapshot than `cells: Vec<u32>`.
2. **Measure the renderer-dependent gates** (need GPU/display): #4 first-frame, #5
   full-app RSS + VRAM, #6 idle CPU, and the orphaned §6.1 #2/#3 (keystroke-to-glyph
   p99, throughput). Re-measure #5-RSS for real once the windowed app is sampled.
3. **Wire `bongterm-mux` panes into the app** (code; **human visual**) — #7.
4. **Wire the ledger dashboard into the app** + build `CurrentProcessSampler::
   register_pid` + per-pane process-tree attribution **as part of this wiring** (NOT
   in isolation — the per-pane PID→pane mapping contract is defined by how the app
   spawns shells into panes; building a flat `register_pid` first risks rework). — #17.
5. **Confirm CI for real**: fix the `master`-vs-`main` trigger mismatch on
   `ci.yml`/`nightly.yml`, then push/PR so they run on `windows-latest`.

> **Shape note:** the renderer swap is high-risk done blind. Prefer an *interactive*
> session — the agent writes the wiring, the user runs `cargo run -p bongterm-app`
> and reports what renders — rather than committing rendering code no one has seen run.

Do **not** mark #4/#5-VRAM/#6/#7/#17 green from a headless harness — they are only
real with a display/GPU and a human looking at the window.
